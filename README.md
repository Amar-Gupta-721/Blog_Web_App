# Blog Web App

I've developed a blog web app with various features such as login, logout, signup, password management, and CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for posts. The frontend is handled by me, while the backend services are provided by Appwrite, which offers backend-as-a-service (BaaS) capabilities. This allows me to focus on the frontend while leveraging Appwrite for backend functionalities like authentication, database management, and more.

üåü Tech Stack

1. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript‚Äã: The foundation of the frontend, ensuring a clean and responsive user interface. 
2. ReactJS: The backbone of the UI, allowing for dynamic rendering and a smooth user experience. 
3. Redux: Managing the application state efficiently and ensuring that data flows seamlessly throughout the app. 
4. Tailwind CSS & Material UI: A perfect blend of utility-first and component-based styling, giving the app a modern and polished look. 
5. Appwrite: The powerful backend-as-a-service (BaaS) that handles authentication, database management, and more.

üîí Key Features

1. Authentication: Secure user login and signup with robust authentication mechanisms. 
2. Email Verification: Ensuring user authenticity through a simple email verification process. 
3. Forgot Password: A user-friendly way to recover accounts with ease. 
4. CRUD Operations: Full-fledged Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities to manage content efficiently. 
5. Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive and optimized for all screen sizes‚Äîfrom mobile devices to large desktop monitors.
